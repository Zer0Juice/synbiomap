# Patents, Papers, Parts & Planet

**Do student iGEM projects, academic papers, and patents in synthetic biology form semantically related local innovation trajectories at the city level?**

This repository holds the full research pipeline and documentation website for my Master's thesis. It studies synthetic biology innovation across three kinds of knowledge artifact: student projects (iGEM), academic publications (OpenAlex), and patents (USPTO). We ask whether, within a city, these three types work on related topics. The primary worked example is **carbon capture using cyanobacterial fermentation.**

Claims here are about *semantic relatedness and association*

## Project website

[**zer0juice.github.io/synbiomap**](https://zer0juice.github.io/synbiomap): the main public-facing home for the project (background, methods, results, the carbon-capture case study, and interactive explorers).

## What's in this repo

| Path | What it is |
|------|-----------|
| `src/` | Reusable Python modules — ingestion, embedding, clustering, geocoding, analysis. All pipeline logic lives here. |
| `scripts/` | Numbered, runnable pipeline steps that call `src/`. See [`scripts/README.md`](scripts/README.md) for the full ordered list. |
| `notebooks/` | Walkthroughs and the case study. See [`notebooks/README.md`](notebooks/README.md). |
| `data/processed/` | The normalized datasets (committed — see below). |
| `config/settings.yaml` | Every pipeline parameter in one place. |
| `models/specter2_synbio/` | The fine-tuned SPECTER2 adapter used for the tripartite analysis. |
| `website/` | The Quarto documentation site (the top-level deliverable). |
| `manuscript/` | The LaTeX manuscript (`main.tex`). |
| `outputs/` | Generated figures and the Beamer slide deck. |

## Two ways to use this repo

**A. Explore the results (no credentials needed).** The processed datasets in
`data/processed/` and the website's precomputed projection data in
`website/assets/data/` are committed. You can open the notebooks, read the CSVs,
or run the website straight after cloning, with no API keys required.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zer0Juice/synbiomap
cd synbiomap
pip install -r requirements.txt
quarto preview website        # browse the site locally
```

**B. Rebuild from raw sources.** Re-running ingestion and embedding needs API
credentials and is time-consuming. Raw downloads and the embedding cache are
*not* committed (too large / re-fetchable); everything needed to regenerate them
is in `scripts/`.

```bash
cp .env.example .env          # then fill in your API keys
# place the iGEM CSV exports under data/raw/ (see scripts/03_ingest_projects.py)
# then follow the ordered steps in scripts/README.md
```

## Corpus construction strategy

**Papers** follow Shapira, Kwon & Youtie (2017, *Scientometrics*): a layered keyword approach where core terms (`"synthetic biology"`, `"synthetic genomics"`, `"BioBrick"`) are combined with subfield terms (`"repressilator"`, `"minimal genome"`, `"genetic toggle switch"`, …). Broad terms such as `"metabolic engineering"` are intentionally excluded — they would swamp the corpus with unrelated work. Retrieval is supplemented by citation expansion from two seed papers (see `config/settings.yaml → corpus`).

**Patents** data set is from Paul Oldham: https://github.com/poldham/synbio
This data is supplemented by abstracts and geocoding based on inventor addresses pulled through the [USPTO's Open Data Portal](https://data.uspto.gov)

All parameters live in `config/settings.yaml`.

## Methods summary

| Step | Method | Reference |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Corpus construction | Layered keyword + citation-seed search | Shapira et al. (2017); van Doren et al. (2013) |
| Case-study tagging | Keyword match on title + abstract (`carbon_capture_keywords`) | — |
| Embeddings | SPECTER2 (`allenai/specter2`), with a synthetic-biology fine-tuned adapter (`models/specter2_synbio/`) for the tripartite analysis | Cohan et al. (2020); Singh et al. (2022) |
| Dimensionality reduction | UMAP, cosine metric | McInnes et al. (2018) |
| Clustering | HDBSCAN | Campello et al. (2013) |
| Relatedness test | City-level cluster co-membership vs. a permutation null | `src/analyze/relatedness.py` |
| Geocoding | Nominatim (OpenStreetMap), cached | — |

Embeddings are cached as sharded `.npy` batches under `data/embeddings/`, not a single file.

## Reproducing the analysis

The full, ordered pipeline is documented in [`scripts/README.md`](scripts/README.md). In short: ingest (01–03) → base embed/cluster (04–07) → fine-tune SPECTER2 → build and analyze the tripartite corpus (08–12) → robustness and case-study figures/tables (13–17). The two marimo notebooks narrate the main analysis and the carbon-capture case study on top of the processed outputs.
